Add another subclass Microwave. The Microwave must have max temperature and current
temperature, capacity and current load to track how much of the capacity is occupied.
• We should be able to set temperature, but we cannot exceed the max temperature or set it
below 10 degrees.
• We should be able to heat anything that is in the Microwave. But we cannot start heating if
temperature is not set (different than 0).
• We should be able to put food in the Microwave. The food will be measured in liters and we
should not be allowed to add more food if we exceed the capacity.
• Add implementation for the factory reset method
Create object an Microwave Object. Use the specific functionalities to update the state of the Object
(ex. Set specific temperature).
Display the information for the Object
Use the factory reset and display again the information for the Object
Hint: Use Inheritance and Polymorphism
