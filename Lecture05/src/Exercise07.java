/*
Create an interactive Java program that challenges the user to guess a randomly generated
number. Write a Java program that generates a random number between 1 and 100.Prompt the
user to guess the number by entering a value. After each guess, inform the user whether their
guess was correct, too high, or too low. Continue prompting the user for guesses until they
correctly guess the number. Once the correct number is guessed, print a congratulatory
message and terminate the loop.
